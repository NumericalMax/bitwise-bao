# Basic arithmetic operations (bao) implemented with bitwise operators
This is an implementation of basic arithmetic functions (e.g. plus, minus) in C++ in which only bitwise operators are allowed. It is solely designed for the datatype integer.

# +
Summation of two integers a and b: a + b

# -
Subtraction of two integers a and b: a - b

# *
Multiplication of two integers a and b: a * b

# /
Division of two integers a and b without rest: a / b

# How to execute in terminal:

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
